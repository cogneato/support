We strictly operate as a business-to-consumer provider. As such, we cannot include your VAT number on the invoice.

If you’re located in the EU or UK, and you’re seeing VAT charged, it’s because our services are provided to private individuals. We are VAT registered where required by law, but as a business-to-consumer provider, our VAT registration does not allow customers to reclaim or reverse-charge VAT.

You can update your billing name and address by visiting [account.nabucasa.com](https://account.nabucasa.com/).

Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on "Manage Account" to make changes. This information will appear on future invoices only, so be sure to update it before your next billing cycle. This is especially helpful if you need your invoices for expense reporting or reimbursement.
