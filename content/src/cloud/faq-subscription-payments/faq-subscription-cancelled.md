If several payment attempts fail, PayPal will eventually mark your subscription as suspended. Unfortunately, once this happens, we can’t reactivate the existing agreement and a new subscription must be created through [account.nabucasa.com](https://account.nabucasa.com).

Payment failures can happen for a number of reasons. In some countries, such as India, recurring payments may require manual approval.

If you’re unsure why your payment failed, it’s best to check directly with your bank or card issuer, as they control whether a charge is allowed.
