We don’t offer a lifetime subscription, one-time payment, or student discount.

Home Assistant Cloud exists to support ongoing development of the otherwise free Home Assistant project. A recurring subscription keeps things sustainable and ensures we can continue providing stable, reliable service over time.

If you’re subscribing, you’re helping keep Home Assistant independent and open for everyone!
